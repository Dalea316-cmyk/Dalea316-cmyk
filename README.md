 ### My Projects & Portfolio
 Here are a few highlights from my work:

 - **[Divvy Bike Dataset 1]**:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of the Divvy bike-sharing dataset, focusing on understanding ridership patterns and station performace. Key technologies utilized include MYSQL for efficient data storage, management, and complex querying, and Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into popular routes, peak usage times, rider demographics such as annual members vs. casual user behavior, and the overall operational efficiency of the Divvy bike-sharing system. This project demonstrates proficiency in data extraction, transformation, loading 9ETL), and presenting data-driven findings.
